Are you oversupplying electricity? Excess electricity supply will not help achieve an 80% cut.</p>

Have you electrified transport, heat or industry? If not, these sectors will be consuming fossil fuels and could stop you from meeting the target. Despite big increases in electricity use, liquid fuel, such as biofuel, will still be needed in 2050. So take a look at the 'flow' view to make sure you have enough low carbon liquid fuel.</p>

For example, if you increase the level of offshore wind, more turbines at sea will appear.</p>

To do this, a broad range of experts were consulted from inside and outside government.
