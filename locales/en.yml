    body: "By the year 2050 we need to dramatically change the way we produce and consume energy.<br>Government targets require us to reduce emmissions to 20% of 1990 levels."
    button: "Start"

  guide:
    '1': "The UK is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050, relative to 1990 levels.


      To do this we must decarbonise the UK economy while ensuring secure and affordable energy supplies."

    '2': "How should this be done? The 2050 Calculator lets you take control and propose your own energy pathway for the country."

    '3': "The calculator allows you to consider the choices and trade-offs we face. It covers all parts of the economy and all greenhouse gas emissions released in the UK."

    '4': "The calculator models what is thought to be physically and technically possible in forty-two different sectors. It is based on scientific and engineering data and was built in collaboration with a wide range of organisations from inside and outside of government."

    '5': "The model, all its assumptions and the code for this interface are all available open source.

    '6': "### Let's get started...

      When you open the calculator for the first time you'll notice the 80% CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction target at the top of the page."

    '7': "The sliders on the right hand side of the page can be used to adjust the emphasis and effort on choices and trade-offs for energy demand, supply and other factors. As these sliders are adjusted, the calculator will update it's forecast and update your progress in the reduction target bar.


      Use the \"Demand\", \"Supply\" and \"Other\" tabs to toggle between the available sliders."

    '8': "On the left hand side of the page there are 8 distinct areas representing various indicators that will be affected by your choices and trade-offs. These represent the effect on the supply and demand of energy and electricity as well as environmental and economical impacts.


      Click through each tab to see how your pathway affects these."

    '9': "For example pathways, use the menu button in the top left of the page to reveal the main menu, and click on \"Example Pathways\" to reveal a set of example pathways you are able to load into the calculator."

    '10': "Once you've hit the 80% reduction target use the \"Finish & Share\" button for an overview of your pathway results and options to to share your pathway with friends and colleagues."

          not: "This tool does not model the hourly, daily or even seasonal operation of the electricity grid. It presents annual averages. Therefore it does not correctly represent the peaks and troughs of electricity demand.


            To go some way to addressing this flaw, the tool applies a simulated stress test to your pathway of five cold, almost windless, days. This is described in more detail here.
            In this case, the stress test implies that 0 GW of additional peaking plant may be required for supply to meet demand over that period.


            You can influence the amount of peaking plant by changing your choice level of 'storage, demand shifting & interconnection' below right, or by reducing the amount of intermittent renewable generation, or by reducing the demand for electricity"
